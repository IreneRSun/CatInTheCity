# CatInTheCity

## Description
This is an interactive weather reporting webpage that has an attractive UI where you can watch the weather forecast play on your screen.

My motivation for this project was to learn new concepts and languages by applying them. I wanted to have some fun while doing it, hence why the project's user interface differs a lot from conventional weather reporting applications.

## Disclaimer
This is a personal project made for learning purposes, so it is for personal use only. I will not be responsible for any loss or damage incurred by its use.

I do not own any of the images and sound files stored in the assets folder. All credit goes to their respective owners.

All weather data was recieved from https://www.weatherapi.com/ using an API call.
